## Reinforcement-Learning-Introduction
Code for simple reinforcement learning algorithms (Q-learning, SARSA) using tabular and linear approximation, as well as eligibility traces.

Three different jupyter notebooks are available. In each of them, a brief overview of the theory behind different RL methods is presented and accompanied by coding examples. 

This work is based on Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto. 1998. Introduction to Reinforcement Learning. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, USA
